A decision tree classifier is a popular machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It is a type of supervised learning algorithm that creates a model to predict the target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the features of the input data.

The algorithm builds a tree-like model, where each internal node represents a decision based on a feature, each branch represents the outcome of that decision, and each leaf node represents a class label. The decision tree is constructed by recursively partitioning the data into subsets based on the feature that provides the most information gain or the highest Gini index.
